## Friends Shortest Path

Java program that implements a breadth-first search algorithm to find three different information of a graph, its. Problem was to calculate a shortest path from a starting vertex in a graph to each other vertex. The vertices represent people and each person is related to every other person through parent-child relationships. A person can see how they are related to each other person in the tree.

## Pizza Order App

Worked on a team of three students to develop an android app in Java for managing pizza orders. Users can take orders of customizable pizzas, place the order, and cancel them. Users can also check all orders placed by the user. Used Android Studio to create the GUI.
